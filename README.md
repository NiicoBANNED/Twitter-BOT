# Remember

If you are going to host your twitter bot on a page where they can read your code, I recommend that you create an .env file and put your twitter keys in there to have greater security of your bot.

# Dependences

You will need to install these packages for the bot to work properly:

⚫ Tweepy: pip install tweepy (this is the easiest and fastest way of installation)

⚫ Schedule: pip install schedule (this is the easiest and fastest way of installation)
